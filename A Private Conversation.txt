Last week, I went to a theatre.
The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it.
A young man and a young woman was sitting behind me.
The were talking loudly. I could not hear the actors.
I turned round.
I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention.
In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again.
'I can't hear a word.' I said angrily.
'It's none of your business.' The young man said rudely.
'This is a private conversation.'
